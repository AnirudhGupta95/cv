      encoded by using utf8 encoding system.
      THere are different type of encodings and they are specified for different

    <!-- p tag is used to write the paragraph while em tag is to italicise
        i tag is also used to italicize the text but there is a little bit of
        difference here from the em tag.
        The em tag tells the browser the the words inside needs an emphasis and
        it also italicizes the text but i tag only italicizes the text.
        It is a good practice to always use em tag instead of i tag because it
        conveys more information and it isnâ€™t just about the style.

        a is the anchor tag and it is used to add hyperlinks to the HTML document
        href is the hyoerlink reference that contains the site address or URL
        which the link will take the user to.
        For more information on a tag, see Notion notes.
